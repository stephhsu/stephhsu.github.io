                I'm in my 4th year of studies at the University of Waterloo, specifically in the 
                <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering 
                </a>program. 
                <br><br>
                As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality" target="_blank">ISFP</a>, I've always loved 
                coming across new experiences, which at the moment has led me to develop an interest in technologies that solve problems.
                Through my past few years in this program, I have developed an admiration for the wide range of industries that software 
                touches and supports. At my most recent internship at <a href="https://www.shareworks.com/" target="_blank">Shareworks by
                Morgan Stanley</a>, I was fortunate to be able to dive into the world of equity management.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not doing schoolwork or exploring the tech world, you can find me visiting <a href="https://cows.ca/" target="_blank">
                my favorite ice cream establishment in Banff AB</a>, assembling <a href="https://www.tamiya.com/" target="_blank">Tamiya plastic 
                models</a>, or enjoying a nice warm cup of tea.
                <br><br>
