            <h1>Thoughts on my Break In At Boston Boulevard project</h1>
            <p class="project-reflection-blurb">
                This was my first project! It's by no means perfect or complex, but it's something I'm proud of to this day 
                because Python was the first programming language I learned and this was beyond the command line exercises I 
                was previously doing (I'm a visual person). 
                <br><br>
                This project was a fun one to plan out, code, and most importantly, test out. Finding all the bugs and fixing them made 
                the game feel more polished and satisfying to play. There are inevitably still somes bugs in there (maybe you can find 
                them and let me know :p), however besides that, I think that I'll leave the game as is.
