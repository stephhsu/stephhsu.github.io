            <p class="co-op-reflection-blurb">
                My first co-op! That in itself was an exciting experience and a big blessing considering I came into the ECE program with 
                little programming experience or idea of what "co-op" was. 
                <br><br>
                This is where I learned the basics of quality assurance, as well as came to appreciate all the work QA's do to ensure a 
                well-designed software product or product in general. I learned the importance of keeping track of what lead to bugs, being 
                thorough with your testing, and writing clear and well thought out test cases. I got to experience working in an agile
                environment. 
                <br><br>
                Although I admit the manual testing got a bit tedious towards the middle of the term, it made getting to spearhead the 
                automation process for the QA team the highlight of this co-op. From standardizing feature files using Gherkin's Cucumber 
                to writing unit tests using JUnit and Selenium to making mistakes with Git, the last month of co-op felt the most engaging 
                as we got to take initiative and learn about new tools. 
                <br><br>
                Overall, I learned a lot about product testing and that I liked programming more than I initially thought, which set 
                a direction of what I was looking for in my second co-op. :)
