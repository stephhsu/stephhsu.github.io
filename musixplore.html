            <p class="project-reflection-blurb">
                I grew an interest in web development in Fall 2019, however it did not come into fruition until this past summer (Summer 2020). 
                This was my first web project, inspired by my desire to learn React as well as my daily, if not hourly, use of Spotify. After
                learning the basics off Google, I decided to solidify my understanding as well as refresh my memory on how to
                retrieve data from an API.
                <br><br>
                Although there were many bumps in the road (mostly API and JSON data related), it was ultimately a rewarding experience, especially
                when the data finally showed up in the console or the props were successfully passed down to the child page. In the end, it ended 
                up being larger than what I had expected. Initially, I was thinking of a simple one-page React app, but eventually I learned the 
                React Router tool when I realized it had to be more than one page due to the variations of data passed by albums, playlists, and 
                songs.
                <br><br>
                Looking back now, I realize that I should have planned more in advance, because there is a lot of code that is repeated, that I can 
                definitely refactor by using more in-line conditions. I guess that's a task for the future, along with a few other features and 
                modifications I want to implement:
                <ul class="future-features">
                    <li>a search bar for looking up songs, playlists, albums, artists</li>
                    <li>a music player to play the songs</li>
                    <li>song lyrics - probably will acheive with web scraping</li>
                    <li>a redesign of the ui - it looks ok right now, more time could be spent on revamping it</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </body>
