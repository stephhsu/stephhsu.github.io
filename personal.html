            <h2>What I Believe</h2>
            <p class="more-about-moi-blurb">
                I'm a Christian! I wholeheartedly believe that I wouldn't be standing where I am, in this program, with the friends that 
                I've made, with the experiences I've had thus far, if it weren't for God and His grace. I came to faith at the beginning 
                of my undergrad, when God opened my eyes to understand just a sliver of how truly amazing and mind-blowing His love and
                mercy is for His people. I guess this leads us to ...

            <h2>The Gospel</h2>
            <p class="more-about-moi-blurb">
                What is the Gospel? 
                <br><br> 
                The Gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins, so that we 
                would not have to face the judgement and wrath of God for the wrongs we have committed against Him. Not only that, Christ 
                rose from the dead, triumphant over his enemies, giving those who believe an everlasting joy and hope. However, if we don't 
                believe in this good news, the Bible makes it clear that we will be given the just penalty for our sins, which is eternal 
                suffering in hell where we are eternally seperated from God.
                <br><br>
                I know that's quite a message to take in! That was but a short summary of the core message of the Bible, which is what we 
                Christians believe to be the truth as God's word. There is much historical evidence pointing to the accuracy of what 
                is written in the Bible.
