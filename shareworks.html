            <h1>Reflection on my time at Shareworks at Morgan Stanley</h1>
            <p class="co-op-reflection-blurb">
                This was my first time doing development work for a co-op! I got to do both front-end and back-end development so that was great. 
                The other co-op and I spent the first month learning the ropes of the company and its product along with navigating the code base 
                and developing a date picker feature that was supposed to speed up the calculation for bulk sale or transfer events. Afterwards, 
                we did some work with the databases and SQL queries to convert the data to the client's requirements. Finally, we got moved to 
                a different team and worked on the client siteâ€™s accessibility, making sure it worked with keyboard navigation and screen 
                readers. On top of all this, I finally learned how to play Among Us B)
                <br><br>
                Overall, I appreciated all advice and best practice tips my mentor and the rest of the team gave us. Although the work was not the 
                most exciting, I still learned a lot of basics that are easily transferable to future experiences. For future co-ops, I would like 
                to work with newer tech stacks and mostly focus on back-end work.
