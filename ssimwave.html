                I went in to this term knowing absolutely nothing about video and audio, except for how to play it, pause it, and change the volume,
                so this co-op was an extremely educational experience. Thanks to the patience of and many explanations given by the full-time employees, 
                I learned about the small details that come with media and streams.
                <br><br>
                This was my first time extensively using Linux and its terminal to perform everything outside of testing the product's UI. 
                It was also my first time using virtual machines and using different tools to set up local environments. As you can see, there 
                were a lot of firsts this term. I spent the time in between test runs researching video, audio, and streaming tools and developing
                back-end and front-end test cases for new features.
                <br><br>
                Overall, I really enjoyed this co-op and a large part of it was the company's atmosphere. The full-times were very
                approachable and us co-ops worked very well together to get tasks done. One thing that I would like in my next co-op though
                would be more opportunities to do some programming as the opportunity to do so in this one was few and far between.
