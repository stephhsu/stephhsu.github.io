            <h1>Thoughts on my WeatherCheck project</h1>
            <p class="project-reflection-blurb">
                After reaching a point of being satisfied with my musixplore project, I wanted to also refresh my Python skills, as it had been a few
                years since I had programmed in Python. After a quick tutorial, I decided to tackle a small project and ended up deciding to pick up 
                Django as I already had an interest in web dev. In my search for projects to do, I had also stumbled upon the term "web scraping", and 
                after some research, decided that it would be a good way of getting my data for this project.
                <br><br>
                The project itself was relatively straight forward, thanks to the many libraries available on Python and the power of the internet. 
                The Beautiful Soup Python Library was used to parse the data I had scraped off of Google and a quick search on the internet showed 
                me how to web scrap Google's weather data. After adding some template conditional rendering, a function to compare sunset time with
                current time, and some CSS styles, I was ready to push it onto GitHub. However, I shortly realized that GitHub Pages, my usual website 
                hosting platform, did not support Django apps because they are not a static page. I decided to use Heroku instead, but actually had a 
                lot of issues dealing with properly deploying the static resources of my project. Eventually, I sorted it all out thanks to Stack 
                Overflow.
                <br><br>
                Overall, I am satisfied with the end product. The UI is simple and the search function works well. There are, of course, other features 
                that I would like to implement in the near future, such as:
                <ul class="future-features">
                    <li>a settings page to toggle temperature from Celsius to Farenheit and the UI from light mode to dark mode</li>
                    <li>the weather for the coming 7 days</li>
                    <li>warnings for thunderstorms, tornados, hurricanes, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
